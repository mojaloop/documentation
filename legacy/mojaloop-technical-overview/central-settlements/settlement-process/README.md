# Settlement Process

## 1. Database Design

### Notes:

- `settlementWindow` - a table where all settlement windows are stored;
- `settlementWindowStateChange` - stores information regarding settlement windows state;
- `settlement` - keeps data regarding all settlements;
- `settlementContentAggregation` - contains aggregated values for a settlement, participant currency, role type and ledger entry type grouping in a settlement;
- `settlementModel` - contains the configured settlement models for the switch;
- `settlementWindowContent` - contains an entry for each item of content in a given settlement window, broken down by ledger account type and currency;
- `settlementWindowContentStateChange` - tracks settlement window content state changes;
- `settlementSettlementWindow` - association table for settlements and settlement windows, providing connection many-to-many;
- `settlementStateChange` - tracks the settlement state change;
- `settlementTransferParticipant` - this table is used for staging data for all transfers which are to be included in a settlement;
- `settlementParticipantCurrency` - stores grouped information by participant and currency. For calculation of netAmount, the summarized data from `settlementTransferParticipant` is used;
- `settlementParticipantCurrencyStateChange` - used to track the state change of each individual settlement participant account.

The remaining tables in the below ERD are either transfer-specific (gray) or lookup (blue) and are included as direct dependencies to depict the relation between the settlement tables and transfer specific entities.

### 2.1. Settlement Windows By Params

Used for acquiring information regarding Settlement Windows. E.g.:
1. Find the ID of the current OPEN window by querying by state and later use the information for closing that window;
2. Find all CLOSED and/or ABORTED windows to be used for creating a settlement;
3. Other reporting needs.

### 2.2. Settlement Windows By Params

Used for acquiring settlement window information when ID is present.
- [Sequence Diagram for Request Settlement Window by Id](get-settlement-window-by-id.md)

### 2.3. Close Settlement Window

There is always one open settlement window which groups all ongoing transfers. This functionality is used to close the currently opened window and create the next one. The operations starts on the API and then the Deferred handler consumes a message after the validations are passed and prepares the Settlement Window Content and Settlement Content Aggregation records for the settlement process.

### 2.4. Create Settlement

The creation of settlement is possible when at least one OPEN or ABORTED window is provided. The data from all transfers in all provided windows is summarized and as a result the settlement amount is calculated per participant and currency. Depending on its sign we distinct 3 types of participants in regards to the newly created settlement: SETTLEMENT_NET_RECIPIENT, SETTLEMENT_NET_SENDER and SETTLEMENT_NET_ZERO. Newly generated id of type bigint is returned as a response together it all other information.

### 2.5. Request Settlement

This endpoint is used for acquiring information regarding a settlement and all included windows and accounts/positions. The ID from the previous request is being utilized for that purpose.

### 2.6. Settlement Transfer Acknowledgment

It is used to advance the settlement through all the states initiated with the creation and finilized by settle or abort. The actual state flow is:
- PENDING_SETTLEMENT: The net settlement report for this window has been taken, with the parameter set to indicate that settlement is to be processed;
- PS_TRANSFERS_RECORDED: Record transfer entries against the Position Account and the Multi-lateral Net Settlement Account, these are the "multi-lateral netÂ  settlement transfers" (MLNS transfers). An identifier might be provided to be past to the reference bank;
- PS_TRANSFERS_RESERVED: All the debit entries for the MLNS transfers are reserved;
- PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED: All the credit entries for the MLNS transfers are committed. An identifier might be received and recorded from the Settlement bank to allow reconciliation;
- SETTLING: If all accounts are not yet SETTLED, the Status of the settlement is moved to SETTLING. Note: applies only on settlement level;
- SETTLED: Final state when all outstanding accounts are SETTLED, the entire Settlement is moved to SETTLED.

### 2.7. Settlement Abort

- ABORTED: Final state when the settlement is not possible. Please, note the settlement might be aborted up to when no account/position has been marked as PS_TRANSFERS_COMMITTED. Also there is no possibility to mark an individual account as ABORTED, but rahter the entire settlement is ABORTED. After performing such operation there is possibility to create a new settlement by including only non-problematic ABORTED accounts

### 2.8. Request Settlement By SPA

Used to request drill-down information regarding a settlement, participant and account. Even though participant and account are optional, the order settlement/{id}/participant/{id}/account/{id} is mandatory.

### 2.9. Request Settlements By Params

This endpoint enables advanced reporting capabilities.

### 2.10 Gross Settlement Handler

This handler executes after each transfer is committed and performs the following operations on success:
  Handle the updating of the POSITION and SETTLEMENT accounts for participants involved in a transfer where there is a settlement model defined as immediate and gross on the POSITION account to facilitate RTCGS (Real-Time Continuous Gross Settlement) per transfer.

This is done by consuming events of the notification topic.

- [Sequence Diagram for Gross Settlement Handler](gross-settlement-handler-consume.md)

### 2.11 Rules Handler

This handler executes after each transfer is committed and performs the following operations on success:
 Execute the rules defined by the scripts in the SCRIPTS_FOLDER. The rules are validated for valid headers before loading.

This is done by consuming events of the notification topic.

- [Sequence Diagram for Rules Handler](rules-handler-consume.md)

### 2.12 Deferred Handler

This handler executes after close settlement window operation has been received and validated:

   Handle the updating of the participant accounts involved in the transfers for the settlement window that is closed. The process then continues with settlement event trigger.

This is done by consuming events of the notification topic, that are emitted by the service after close settlement window command has been sent and validated.
