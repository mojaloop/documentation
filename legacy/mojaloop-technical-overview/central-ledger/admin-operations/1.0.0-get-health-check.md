# GET Health Check

Design discussion for new Health Check implementation.


## Objectives

The goal for this design is to implement a new Health check for mojaloop switch services that allows for a greater level of detail.

It Features:
- Clear HTTP Statuses (no need to inspect the response to know there are no issues)
- ~Backwards compatibility with existing health checks~ - No longer a requirement. See [this discussion](https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/796#issuecomment-498350828).
- Information about the version of the API, and how long it has been running for
- Information about sub-service (kafka, logging sidecar and mysql) connections

## Request Format
`/health`

Uses the newly implemented health check. As discussed [here](https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/796#issuecomment-498350828) since there will be no added connection overhead (e.g. pinging a database) as part of implementing the health check, there is no need to complicate things with a simple and detailed version.

Responses Codes:
- `200` - Success. The API is up and running, and is sucessfully connected to necessary services.
- `502` - Bad Gateway. The API is up and running, but the API cannot connect to necessary service (eg. `kafka`).
- `503` - Service Unavailable. This response is not implemented in this design, but will be the default if the api is not and running

## Response Format

| Name  | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `status`        | `statusEnum`                       | The status of the service. Options are `OK` and `DOWN`. _See `statusEnum` below_. | `"OK"`   | 
| `uptime`        | `number`                           | How long (in seconds) the service has been alive for.  | `123456`                     |
| `started`       | `string` (ISO formatted date-time) | When the service was started (UTC)                     | `"2019-05-31T05:09:25.409Z"` | 
| `versionNumber` | `string` (semver)                  | The current version of the service.                    | `"5.2.5"`                    |
| `services`      | `Array<serviceHealth>`             | A list of services this service depends on, and their connection status | _see below_ |

### serviceHealth

| Name  | Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name`    | `subServiceEnum`   | The sub-service name. _See `subServiceEnum` below_.       | `"broker"` | 
| `status`  | `enum`             | The status of the service. Options are `OK` and `DOWN`    | `"OK"`     | 

### subServiceEnum

The subServiceEnum enum describes a name of the subservice:

Options:
- `datastore` -> The database for this service (typically a MySQL Database).
- `broker`    -> The message broker for this service (typically Kafka).
- `sidecar`   -> The logging sidecar sub-service this service attaches to.
- `cache`     -> The caching sub-service this services attaches to.


### statusEnum

The status enum represents status of the system or sub-service.

It has two options:
- `OK`    -> The service or sub-service is healthy.
- `DOWN`  -> The service or sub-service is unhealthy.

When a service is `OK`: the API is considered healthy, and all sub-services are also considered healthy.

If __any__ sub-service is `DOWN`, then the entire health check will fail, and the API will be considered `DOWN`.

## Defining Sub-Service health

It is not enough to simply ping a sub-service to know if it is healthy, we want to go one step further. These criteria will change with each sub-service.

### `datastore`

For `datastore`, a status of `OK` means:
- An existing connection to the database
- The database is not empty (contains more than 1 table)


### `broker`

For `broker`, a status of `OK` means:
- An existing connection to the kafka broker
- The necessary topics exist. This will change depending on which service the health check is running for.

For example, for the `central-ledger` service to be considered healthy, the following topics need to be found:
```
topic-admin-transfer
topic-transfer-prepare
topic-transfer-position
topic-transfer-fulfil
```

### `sidecar`

For `sidecar`, a status of `OK` means:
- An existing connection to the sidecar


### `cache`

For `cache`, a status of `OK` means:
- An existing connection to the cache
