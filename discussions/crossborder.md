**Cross-border Workstream Meeting**

March 10th & 11th (London/remote)

**Next Steps for PI:**

•  Proposal for how the CNP query and host oracle services and global goals  - Adrian, Michael 

•  Compound identifiers, ways in which this is captured in the system or expressed in apis - open

•  What information is captured in the data model or the extension list - Michael

**Open Items:**

•  Finalize CNP Requirements

•  FXP Guarantee a given rate

•  How do you get non-Mojaloop folks in the schema?

•  How do we integrate Mojaloop and some Mojaloop scheme to provide a full PVT payments - working group with Michael, Adrian, Sybrin, others as needed

•  How do we manage requests for regulatory reasons

•  Investigate identifier mappings (Map pathfinder accounts/mobile accounts to DFSP unique IDs)

•  Investigate Certification (Hash and PKKI)


Detailed Meeting Notes:
Day #1:
	- Quote response
	
		○ How do we code the SLA into the response
	
		○ Ask a 2nd CNP to route
		
		○ In the API - need to package up how to get it there
		
		○ As a CMP in Mowali if I return a quote response the scheme has implications 
		
		○ Follow the whole route from payer to payee 
		
		○ Limiting the participation of CNP - they need to be the last hop
		
			§ How to define the requirements of a CNP?
	
	- Message format
	
		○ Http syntax
		
		○ Started from the mojaloop scheme 
		
			§ Move towards the CNP should manage the conversion
		
		○ SWIFT version
		
		○ Security - TLS
		
		○ Header/content encrypted in JWS
	
	- Retail system
	
		○ Off network - remit to someone hub
	
	- Data Model
	
		○ Structure: Ways in which we added new information, different routes, etc.
		
		○ Privacy: Visibility and Security  - only accessible to the people that can see it
		
		○ Content of the data model 
	
	- Transfer is done through the switch (movement of money)
	
		○ In mowali - the amounts are expressed but the rate is important because it impacts settlements 
	
		§ Data flow - we add the rate when we send the quote back
		
		§ Added in the extension list - should it be part of the standard?
	
		§ Send and receive amount (differ currency) 
	
	- Data element

		○ Payer DFSP adds it up 
		
		○ Fee element for the transaction 
	
	- Proposal

		○ Account lookup service
	
			§ List of local FSP
		
		○ Switch - need to maintain state and lookup requests
	
			§ Should look like a domestic transfer to the sender
			
			§ Collect the information and send it back -
		
		○ CNP - making assumptions to meet requirements
		
			§ Do you need to see the route
			
			§ Collecting different information downstream
			
			§ Sending FSPs needs to know who is the receiver
			
		○ CNP has to aggregate information and put them together into a single request & they will need to sign separately 
			
			§ Condition and fulfillment is part of a PKI structure
			
			§ If there is more than one CNP - there needs to ensure the DFSP payee has to be certain the DFSP payer - connections

			§ Public key -  need to join a mojaloop network have to issue public keys
			
			§ Central certificate issuing authority 
			
			§ Need a PKI structure in place 
		
		○ How do you get non-Mojaloop folks in the schema?
		
			§ How do we integrate Mojaloop and some Mojaloop scheme to provide a full PVT payments - working group with Michael, Adrian, Sybrin, others as needed
			
			§ Identify the participants  -  FSP, DFSP - all have signed
			
			§ Parties - end users (Bob/Alice)
			
			§ Single transaction (with multiple transfers)
			
			§ No one commits their funds to everyone is satisfied 
			
			§ How to extend mojaloop and non-mojaloop scheme 
		
		○ Certification

			§ Gold and silver network
	
			§ New partner - live on the network 
			
			§ Scheme decides requirement on the network 
			
			§ Self-signing cert

			§ There is a dictionary 
			
				□ Is the a requirement to share KYC?
			
				□ You can ask for many things - up to the participant 
				
				□ Need to agree on the baseline scheme

**Day #2:**

	- Switch data
	
		○ Account numbers
		
		○ Blacklist, white list (oversight and blocking)
		
		○ Keeping it simple
		
		○ Hub 
		
		○ Side service for folks that can do this
		
			§ Mobile data capture
			
			§ Side car
			
			§ Digital process 
			
			§ Value added services for the hub (managed service)
	
	- Switch - need to maintain state and lookup requests
	
	- CNP can be an ordinary DFSP
	
		○ All DFSP supports all the use cases
		
		○ Full participants (might just provide a CNP or FXP service)
	
	- FXP definition and requirements
	
		○ FXP - require rates/fees as part of the Quoting service - need standard industry rate
		
			§ CNPs can extend this and determine additional scheme rules
		
		○ FXP handles rounding errors 
		
		○ Guarantee a given rate
		
		○ Manage settlement across schemas
		
		○ FX rates
		
		○ Should allow people that just do FX
		
		○ Edge cases for failure

			§ Rates are in the extended list (are the list)
			
			§ Where the FXP is applied ?
			
			§ What do we do with fees downstream
			
				□  (payee DFSP takes place of the aggregation)
	
	- How to manage identifier resolution 
	
		○ 2 types of Identifiers
		
			§ Global ones (pass to CNP) - to get a response
			
			§ Local ones - expect the user to provide
		
		○ Mojaloop we use identifiers as proxy 
		
		○ Merchant numbers might be specific to a scheme 
		
		○ Multiple identifiers for a single account
		
		○ How do we uniquely identify the account?
		
		○ Rely on CNP (restrict each identifiers in this scheme)
		
		○ What sort of structures in place
		
		○ Passport identification - place holders
		
		○ Map pathfinder accounts/mobile accounts to DFSP unique IDs
		
			§ Service - primary account is X
			
			§ Each country has a service they provide
			
			§ Each CNP understands the address scheme
			
			§ Global one - need to know which ways to use 
		
		○ Sends a get parties to the switch 
		
			§ ALS never heard of them
			
			§ 2 ways 
			
				□ Global way (path finder and conversion to BIC)
	- CNP

		○ Not hosting anything
	
		○ Route through the CNP - ask others
		
		○ Constructing the alternative routes 
	
	- Global registry does not exist
	
		○ Ultimate beneficiary 
		
		○ Established communication
		
		○ Challenge will we able to have 2 DFSPs share direct communication and will be a stretch? 
	
	- Switch has schemes
	
		○ A Hub operator following Scheme Rules may allow names of FSPs as decided by those Rules
		
		○ The technology or the Admin API itself doesn’t restrict the names (apart from restrictions on length, type or characters, etc)
		
		○ BGP: Border Gateway Protocol 
	
	- Query each CNP and then come up with optimizations, matrix that provides global route - goal would be not to query the CNP directly

• How to connect with Mojaloop?
	
	- Any financial service can connect to Mowali
	
	- Scheme rules, technical
	
	- Regulatory 

	- How do I assign stuff? - no one knows the steps
	
	- Mojaloop API - understand this.  
	
	- 2 instances Mojaloop instances - TIPs and Mowali 
	
		○ WOCCU, Asia, US - applied for instance
		
		○ Still pushing the boundries 
	
	- What dos an integration look like
	
		○ Need sandbox, simulators 
		
		○ Standard approach

• Instance payment service

	- Get the flows flowing in a timely manner
	
	- Need real-time ledgers; what happens if they are offline?
	
	- Exception for off network (banks take advantage of float) 

• Discovery process (sending FSP)

	- Switch determines if they need to contact a FXP
	
	- What currency the receiving account can receive in 
	
	- Multiple lookups
	
	- Data model - set of accounts, w/ one currency at a DFSP
