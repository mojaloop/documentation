# Versioning Draft Proposal

>_Note:_ This document is a living draft of a proposal for versioning within Mojaloop. Once the proposal is ready, it will be submitted to the CCB for approval.

__Goal:__ 
- Propose a standard for handling versions across Mojaloop, including :
  1. API versions (FSPIOP API, Hub Operations / Admin API, Settlement API)
  2. Switch Versions, i.e. mojaloop/helm release versions
  3. Internal: version management across microservices within Mojaloop
