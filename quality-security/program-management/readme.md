# Program Management

This section provides an overview of Mojaloop's Risk and Security Management Initiatives.

**Who is this for?**
*Risk Management, Compliance, Governance, Regulatory, and Leadership Stakeholders*

## 1. Mojaloop Data Security and Privacy Program:
### 1.1 Code Quality & Security Program Overview

**Objective:** Continuously improve the Trust (reliability, transparency, privacy, quality, and security) of the Mojaloop System.

**Delivery Model:** Supports both functional and non-functional requirements of the project, working alongside with other workstreams & various governance committees on a shared responsibility Model.

#### Approach:
- Standards and Control Centric – Define and maintain Mojaloop software quality and security standards and guidelines – In certain areas we provide reference implementation.
- Risk and Threat Centric – Perform risk and threat modelling to identify, validate, classify & prioritize security requirements.

#### Key Milestones:
- PI 1 – 8: Foundation Phase - Built-in confidentiality and Integrity as part of the Core Mojaloop Architecture.
  - Developed and Implemented (To some degree) Signatures, MTLS, PKI, encryption standards 
  -	Established a code quality and security framework - DevOps & CI/CD Tools automation, workflows & policies
- PI 9 – Current: Improvement Phase – Consolidate, optimize & improve.
  - Introduced a risk and threat driven approach 
  - Baselining Mojaloop against best practice standards – PCI DSS and GDPR
  - Focus on the data – Data Protection Standards and Introduction of a Cryptographic Processing Module (CPM)

#### Guiding Principles:
- We endeavor to ensure that our policy and governance framework is as lightweight as possible to encourage community volunteers to contribute freely and easily.
- The overarching aim of the Code is to prescribe the use of certain quality/security practices and techniques delivered as guidelines and in some areas, we have reference technology implementations whereas for other areas we require certain policies or standards to be adhered to and verifiable.

### 1.2 Current PI Objectives (PI 12)
