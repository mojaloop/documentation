# Quality & Security

<img src="./assets/cqs_overview.svg" width=600>

The Quality and Security effort in Mojaloop is focused on delivering high quality, secure, and maintable software. This spans from recommending best practices for deployers to architecting processes to ensure that our code is scanned for vulnerabilities and security patches are applied regularly.

## Overview

We break down this effort into the following three categories:

1. [Program Management](./program-management/)
1. [Standards + Guidelines](./standards-guidelines/)
1. [Reference Implementation](./reference-implementation.md)
