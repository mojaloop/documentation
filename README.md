> This is the official documentation for the Mojaloop project.

__Live Preview: [docs-preview.moja-lab.live](http://docs-preview.moja-lab.live/)__


## Building and testing locally

```bash

# install npm dependencies
yarn 

# run the local server
yarn run dev
```

## Building the project
Run `yarn run build` to build the project to render the static vuepress site for a deployment.

## Deploying the v2.0 Docs Preview

We deploy these docs automatically with CircleCI upon merges to the `mojaloop-docs-2.0` branch.

Go to: http://docs-preview.moja-lab.live/ to see the live site!

The deploy script does not currently take versioning into account, but will in the future.

> Note: for this to work, we have temporarily disabled the "only build pull requests" setting on Circleci
> Someone please remember to turn that back on!

### Deploying Manually

You can also deploy them manually, by running:
```bash
./scripts/_deploy_preview_s3.sh
``` 

Note that you need to have the `aws` cli, AWS access, and `aws-mfa` set up on your machine for this to work.
