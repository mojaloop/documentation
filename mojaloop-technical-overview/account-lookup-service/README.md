# Account Lookup Service

The **Account Lookup Service** (**ALS**) _(refer to section `6.2.1.2`)_ as per the [Mojaloop {{ book.importedVars.mojaloop.spec.version }} Specification]({{ book.importedVars.mojaloop.spec.uri.doc }}) implements the following use-cases:

* Participant Look-up 
* Party Look-up
* Manage Participants Registry information
    * Adding Participant Registry information
    * Deleting Participant Registry information
    
Use-cases that have been implemented over and above for Hub Operational use: 
* Admin Operations
    * Manage Oracle End-point Routing information
    * Manage Switch End-point Routing information
  
## 1. Design Considerations

### 1.1. Account Lookup Service (ALS)
The ALS design provides a generic Central-Service component as part of the core Mojaloop. The purpose of this component is to provide routing and alignment to the Mojaloop API Specification. This component will support multiple Look-up registries (Oracles). This ALS will provide an Admin API to configure routing/config for each of the Oracles similiar to the Central-Service API for the End-point configuration for DFSP routing by the Notification-Handler (ML-API-Adapter Component). The ALS will in all intense purpose be a switch with a persistence store for the storage/management of the routing rules/config.

#### 1.1.1. Assumptions

* The ALS design will only cater for a single switch for the time being.
* Support for multiple switches will utilise the same DNS resolution mechanism that is being developed for the Cross Border/Network design.

#### 1.1.2. Routing

The routing configuration will be based on the following:
* PartyIdType - See section `7.5.6` of the Mojaloop Specification
* Currency - See section `7.5.5` of the Mojaloop Specification. Currency code defined in [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) as three-letter alphabetic string. This will be optional, however `isDefault` indicator must be set to `true` if the `Currency` is not provided.
* isDefault - Indicator that a specific Oracle is the default provider for a specific PartyIdType. Note that there can be many default Oracles, but there can only be a single Oracle default for a specific PartyIdType. The default Oracle for a specific PartyIdType will only be selected if the originating request does not include a Currency filter.
 

### 1.2. ALS Oracle
The ALS Oracle be implemented as either a **Service** or **Adapter** (semantic dependant on use - Mediation = Adapter, Service = Implementation) will provide a look-up registry component with similar functionality of the `/participants` Mojaloop API resources. It has however loosely based on the ML API specification as it's interface implements a sync pattern which reduces the correlation/persistence requirements of the Async Callback pattern implemented directly by the ML API Spec. This will provide all ALS Oracle Services/Adapters with a standard interface which will be mediated by the ALS based on its routing configuration.  
This component (or back-end systems) will also be responsible for the persistence & defaulting of the Participant details.

_Note: The Participant Lookup use-case similarly applies to for a Payee Initiated use-case such as transactionRequests. The difference being that the Payee is the initiation in the above diagram._

## 5. Database Design

### 5.1. ALS Database Schema

#### Notes
- `partyIdType` - Values are currently seeded as per section _`7.5.6`_ [Mojaloop {{ book.importedVars.mojaloop.spec.version }} Specification]({{ book.importedVars.mojaloop.spec.uri.doc }}).
- `currency` - See section `7.5.5` of the Mojaloop Specification. Currency code defined in [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) as three-letter alphabetic string. This will be optional, and must provide a "default" config if no Currency is either provided or provide a default if the Currency is provided, but only the "default" End-point config exists.
- `endPointType` - Type identifier for the end-point (e.g. `URL`) which provides flexibility for future transport support.
- `migration*` - Meta-data tables used by Knex Framework engine.
- A `centralSwitchEndpoint` must be associated to the `OracleEndpoint` by the Admin API upon insertion of a new `OracleEndpoint` record. If the `centralSwitchEndpoint` is not provided as part of the API Request, then it must be defaulted.

## 6. ALS Oracle Design

Detail design for the Oracle is out of scope for this document. The Oracle design and implementation is specific to each Oracle's requirements.

### 6.1. API Specification

Refer to **ALS Oracle API** in the [API Specifications](../../api/README.md#als-oracle-api) section.
