# Bulk Transfers Design

The Bulk Transfers _(refer to section `6.10`)_ as per the [Mojaloop {{ book.importedVars.mojaloop.spec.version }} Specification]({{ book.importedVars.mojaloop.spec.uri.doc }}) implements the following use-cases:

## 1. Introduction

The Bulk Transfers process is discussed in section 6.10 of the API Definiton 1.0 document, depicted in Figure 60.

## 2. Design Considerations

## 3. Steps involved in the high-level Architecture

    1. [1.0, 1.1, 1.2] An Incoming bulk Transfer request (POST /bulkTransfers) on the ml-api-adapter is placed on kafka topic bulk prepare and a 202 is sent to the Payer FSP
    2. [1.3] Bulk Prepare handler consumes the request, records the status as Received 
        a. Bulk Prepare handler then validates the Bulk and changes state to Pending if the validation is successful
        b. [<alt>1.4] If validaiton fails, Bulk Prepare handler changes the bulkTransferState to Pending_Rejected (an internal state) and produces a message onto the bulk processing topic
            i. Bulk processing Handler then updates the bulkTransferState to Rejected and sends out a notification to the Payer
    3. [1.4] [Continuing 2.a] Bulk Prepare handler breaks down the bulk into individual transfers and puts each of them on the prepare topic
        a. As part of this, each transfer is individually assigned the 'expiration time' of the bulk Transfer itself (and other fields necessary for individual transfers)
    4. [1.5, 1.6, 1.7] Prepare handler, Position handler are refactored to cater to bulk prepare messaging (to handle individual transfers in a bulk, using flags such as type, action, etc)
        a. Reservation of funds --> This is left to the individual handlers and and the whole bulk is then aggregated in the Bulk Processing Handler.
    5. [1.8] Position Handler to produce messages corresponding to individual transfers that are part of a bulk to bulk processing topic
    6. [1.9] For every message consumed from the bulk processing topic a check is made on the Bulk processing Handler to see if thatâ€™s the last individual transfer in a bulk
    7. [1.10, 1.11, 1.12] If it is the last transfer, aggregate the state of all the individual transfers and
        a. If all of them are in reserved state --> Send POST /bulkTransfers to the Payee (by producing a message to the notifications topic which is then consumed by the notification handler)
        b. When bulkTransfer prepare is sent, then change status to Accepted
    8. In a successful case of Prepare - when the PUT from the Payee FSP for bulkFulfil is received, a message is put on the bulk fulfils topic
    9. This is to be consumed by the bulkFulfilHandler, which then change state to Processing
    10. The bulk-fulfil-handler breaks down the bulk into individual transfers and sends each of them through the refactored Fulfil, Position Handlers to commit/abort each of them based on the PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID} message by the Payee and commit/release funds on the Switch
    11. The bulk-processing-handler is to then aggregate all the individual transfer results and change the state of bulkTransfer to Completed/Rejected based on success/failure
        a. If the Payee sends 'committed' for even one of the individual transfers the proposal is to change bulk state to Completed.
        b. However, for step-8 or if the Payee sends 'rejected' as bulkTransferState then final state on Switch should be 'Rejected'
    12. Send notifications to both Payer and Payee

## 4. Notes

### a. Discussion items

Here are some of the interesting aspects of the proposal
    1. NFR: The Switch needs to record the changes and the original request for validation and for auditing purposes
    2. Payload size for a bulk transfer - to be considered for Kafka messaging
        a. Is there a need to rethink the moving of larger messages? Possibly using persistent messages?
        b. Possible size of a bulk transfer - 300,000 messages
        c. Discuss requirements for the size

### b. Proposed New tables

Below are the proposed tables as part of designinig the Bulk transfers
    - bulkTransfer
    - bulkTransferStateChange
    - bulkTransferError
    - bulkTransferDuplicateCheck
    - bulkTransferAssociation
    - bulkTransferExtension
    - bulkTransferFulfilment
    - bulkTransferState
    - bulkProcessingState

### c. Bulk Transfer States

Below are the states of a Bulk transfer as per the Mojaloop API Specification
    - RECEIVED
    - PENDING
    - ACCEPTED
    - PROCESSING
    - COMPLETED
    - REJECTED
