## DA meetings: Overview
The Design Authority meets every week for a weekly update and has ad-hoc or detailed sessions for Specific topics

The meetings are open for the public to participate, though discussions are usually limited to the Board members. However, attendees will be promoted to panelists in meetings if they have designs to be reviewed or proposals for changes.
