# Creating new Features

### Fork

Fork the Mojaloop repository into your own personal space. Ensure that you keep the `master` branch in sync.

Refer to the following documentation for more information: [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

1. Clone repo using Git Fork button \(refer to the above documentation for more information\)
2. Clone your forked repo: `git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<forked_repo>.git`
3. Synchronise your forked repo with Mojaloop

   Add a new upstream repo for Mojaloop `$ git remote add mojaloop https://github.com/mojaloop/<original_repo>.git`

   You should now see that you have two remotes:

   ```bash
    git remote -v
    origin    https://github.com/<your_username>/<forked_repo>.git (fetch)
    origin    https://github.com/<your_username>/<forked_repo>.git (push)
    mojaloop  https://github.com/mojaloop/<original_repo>.git (fetch)
    mojaloop  https://github.com/mojaloop/<original_repo>.git (push)
   ```

4. To sync to your current branch: `git pull mojaloop <current_branch>` This will merge any changes from Mojaloop's repo into your forked repo.
5. Push the changes back to your remote fork: `git push origin <current_branch>`

### Creating a Branch

Create a new branch from the `master` branch with the following format: `<branchType>/<issue#><issueDescription>` where `issue#` can be attained from the Github issue, and the `issueDescription` is the issue description formatted in CamelCase.

1. Create and checkout the branch: `git checkout -b <branchType>/<issue#><issueDescription>` 
2. Push the branch to your remote: `git push origin <branchType>/<issue#><issueDescription>`

Where `<branchType>` can be one of the following:

| branchType | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| feature | Any new or maintenance features that are in active development. |
| hotfix | A hotfix branch is for any urgent fixes. |
| release | A release branch containing a snapshot of a release. |
| backup | A temporary backup branch. Used normally during repo maintenance. |

### Merge into Mojaloop Repo

Once the feature is completed create a PR from your Feature Branch into the `master` branch on the Mojaloop repository \(not your personal repo\) for approval, and check validations \(e.g. unit tests, code coverage, etc executed via CircieCI\).
