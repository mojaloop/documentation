# Participation Tools for Fintechs Workstream
The overall objective of this workstream is to develop a “Fintech Tools” portfolio, with the intention of supporting Fintechs and others in the integration of their systems with a Mojaloop Hub through the PISP interface.

# Business Justification
Make it easier for fintechs to offer services by connecting to a Mojaloop-based payments scheme by reducing time, cost and complexity barriers both technically and from a business perspective.

It is hoped this will foster faster growing and ultimately larger and more inclusive Mojaloop based schemes, which delivers impact in giving more people access to inclusive instant payments.
