# Participation Tools for Fintechs Workstream
The overall objective of this workstream is to develop a “Fintech Tools” portfolio, with the intention of supporting Fintechs and others in the integration of their systems with a Mojaloop Hub through the PISP interface.

# Business Justification
Make it easier for fintechs to offer services by connecting to a Mojaloop-based payments scheme by reducing time, cost and complexity barriers both technically and from a business perspective.

It is hoped this will foster faster growing and ultimately larger and more inclusive Mojaloop based schemes, which delivers impact in giving more people access to inclusive instant payments.

## Latest Update (Summary)
This workstream showcased a PISP demo system during September, highlighting integration of the third-party SDK for initiating Mojaloop Request-to-Pay flows in a simulated fintech environment. 

Initial demos used PISP v1 APIs, but the team is now working to upgrade the SDK to support PISP v2, including implementation of missing endpoints. However, PISP v2 is still incomplete on the switch side. Coordination is ongoing with the core PISP stream. While not yet a full-scale workstream, this collaboration is helping converge frontend fintech tooling with backend switch support.

The next step is to prepare the codebase to be contributed to the Mojaloop open source repository.
