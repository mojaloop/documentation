# LEI Addressing Workstream
This workstream is focused on supporting domestic and cross-border merchant transactions through the adoption of the international LEI identifier. This workstream is a collaboration between the Mojaloop Foundation and GLEIF, and is intended to culminate in a pilot, in cooperation with a Mojaloop adopter.

# Business Justification
Collaboration with GLEIF has strategic advantages for the Mojaloop Foundation, since GLEIF has the backing of the financial sector's "establishment" - the FSB and the G20.

It also helps our credibility in cross-border merchant payments, and complements our work in ISO 20022 by helping introduce LEIs into the Mojaloop ecosystem.

## Latest Update (Summary)
Documentation is currently the primary focus. The workstream is integrating LEI-related process flows into the Introduction to Mojaloop document, and preparing to collaborate with the ISO 20022 workstream on additional message examples, especially a P2B use case featuring LEI as a beneficiary identifier. Broader questions around applying LEIs to DFSP identities have been deferred due to complexity and regulatory implications.
