# LEI Addressing Workstream
This workstream is focused on supporting domestic and cross-border merchant transactions through the adoption of the international LEI identifier. This workstream is a collaboration between the Mojaloop Foundation and GLEIF, and is intended to culminate in a pilot, in cooperation with a Mojaloop adopter.

# Business Justification
Collaboration with GLEIF has strategic advantages for the Mojaloop Foundation, since GLEIF has the backing of the financial sector's "establishment" - the FSB and the G20.

It also helps our credibility in cross-border merchant payments, and complements our work in ISO 20022 by helping introduce LEIs into the Mojaloop ecosystem.

## Latest Update (Summary)
The LEI Addressing workstream has concentrated on preparing a merchant-presented QR code demo for MojaCom 29. The demo shows a merchant identified via a GLEIF-verified LEI, with the system retrieving real-time entity data from GLEIF’s API. Looking beyond the demo, the team plans to explore automated LEI generation during merchant onboarding via the Merchant Registry, and correct population of LEI tags within ISO 20022 message structures. Dialogue has begun with external actors, including CPMI and the financial messaging community, as LEI adoption increasingly intersects with regulatory and scheme-level design conversations.
