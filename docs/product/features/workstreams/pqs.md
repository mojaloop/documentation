## Latest Update (Summary)
The team is working toward a year-end release candidate of 17.2.0, focusing on security hardening, dependency updates, and CI reliability. AI-powered tooling is now generating automated PRs for dependency updates across Mojaloop’s internal packages, significantly reducing manual workload. The Finance Portal requires a more comprehensive rewrite due to outdated technology. The workstream also assessed the Mojaloop IAC sandbox against the new QA Framework.
