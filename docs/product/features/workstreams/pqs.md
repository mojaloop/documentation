## Latest Update (Summary)
The Platform Quality and Security workstream has maintained its focus on vulnerability management, CI/CD upgrades, and software integrity assurance. Mojaloop v17.1.0 was released with zero known vulnerabilities, and the team resolved high-profile issues such as the Axios vulnerability across libraries and services. All Helm charts now support digital provenance, and a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is included in release metadata. CI pipelines are being modernised, and the team resumed efforts toward the OpenSSF/FLOSS self-assessment badge. Some objectives, including finance portal refactoring and integration of GitHub’s new code quality tools, remain active backlog items.
