# Performance Optimisation Workstream
Demonstrate the performance of Mojaloop in a variety of deployment configurations, and develop and publish a whitepaper. Use a baseline on-premises configuration to measure changes in performance between Mojaloop releases.

# Business Justification
A whitepaper that demonstrates how Mojaloop exceeds the performance requirements of adopters would be a valuable tool for the Mojaloop community.

## Latest Update (Summary)
The workstream achieved a major milestone by reaching 1,000 TPS prior to the Nairobi convening. With replication enabled, throughput remains high (950 TPS). The team is now scaling to 2,000 and 2,500 TPS as part of the performance white paper, which will include concrete hardware sizing recommendations. Early TigerBeetle tests suggest dramatic performance improvement and reduced infrastructure cost.

Long-term storage tiering requirements were flagged as essential for regulatory data-retention obligations in high-volume schemes.
