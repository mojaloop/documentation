# Participation Tools Workstream
The overall objective of the Participation Tools workstream is to develop a “DFSP Tools” portfolio, with the intention of supporting DFSPs and SIs in the integration of the DFSP’s systems with a Mojaloop Hub. Rather than only offering semi-finalised solutions, the portfolio will comprise the tools to carry out an integration, plus a set of exemplar implementations, each tailored to a specific type of DFSP.

It should be emphasised to all DFSPs that reaping the benefits of an inclusive instant payments solution such as Mojaloop relies on the implementation of a “whole ecosystem” approach - and this means extending the reach of the Mojaloop service into the DFSPs’ domains, giving them and their customers the advantages of assurance of transaction finality, lower cost and the reliable delivery of every valid transaction.

# Business Justification
By making it easier for different types of DFSP to join a Mojaloop-based payments scheme by reducing time, cost and complexity barriers both technically and from a business perspective, it is hoped this will foster faster growing and ultimately larger and more inclusive Mojaloop based schemes, which delivers impact in giving more people access to inclusive instant payments.

## Latest Update (Summary)
The workstream continues to make progress on participant onboarding, driven by improvements to the Mojaloop Connection Manager (MCM). With MCM now decoupled from the IAC codebase, schemes can adopt it independently, broadening its utility. Documentation has emerged as the most urgent need; a dedicated technical writer is preparing comprehensive materials spanning MCM, Payment Manager, and the Integration Toolkit. Donated documentation from Infitx will be generalised for broader community use. New mini-guides have been published to simplify navigation of Mojaloop tooling.
