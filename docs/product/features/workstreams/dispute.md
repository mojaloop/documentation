# Dispute Management Workstream
This workstream aims to develop a Dispute Management solution that can be integrated with the Mojaloop Core and connected DFSPs to meet the needs of Hub Operators and participating DFSPs, across the full range of deployment types.

# Business Justification
The reliable nature of Mojaloop transactions has meant that there is a need to develop a bespoke, open source solution for dispute management. 

Off the shelf alternatives generally assume that switches operate with limited discovery and little or no agreement of terms, so giving plenty of opportunity for dispute, and consequently these platforms are not a good match for a Mojaloop deployment.
