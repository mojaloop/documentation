# Deployment Tools Workstream
This workstream is concerned with the provision of tools, documentation and support to enable adopters to deploy the Mojaloop software in a variety of environments, cloud and on-premises.

# Business Justification
Providing a well documented, comprehensive suite of tools that enable adopters to engage with, develop, test, evaluate and operate our software is critical to supporting the establishment and long term sustainability of Mojaloop based IIPS. 

The aim is to enable adopters to deploy Mojaloop easily, in the environment of their choice, and with minimal support from the Community.

## Latest Update (Summary)
Recent DRPP contributions to IaC increased infrastructure costs by optimising for high-scale multi-instance deployments. To address the needs of smaller schemes, the team has developed a lightweight alternative—provisionally “IAC Lite.” Test deployments are running in AWS and on Foundation lab equipment. The objective is to deliver a streamlined, low-overhead, open-source deployment experience requiring minimal manual steps.
