# QA Framework Workstream
The overall objective of this workstream is to develop a QA Framework that can be used to validate the configuration, functionality, security, interoperability readiness and performance of a deployment. This framework might be used by adopters to "self certify", or it might be used by an external reviewer to create a level of assurance for supervisory authorities and participants.

# Business Justification
A QA Framework provides a consistent approach for stakeholders to assess the quality and readiness of Mojaloop deployments, supporting independent evaluations of resilience, security, and functional integrity. By establishing a structured approach to assessing deployments, the framework helps:

- Deployment teams identify and address gaps early
- Participants assess operational readiness before onboarding
- Regulators or supervisory bodies interpret implementation quality based on objective inputs
- The Mojaloop community share best practices and align on minimum expectations.

## Latest Update (Summary)
The team presented at MojaCom 29 and aims to position the QA self-assessment framework as a permanent component of Mojaloop implementation guidance. 

The QA Framework workstream reached its first delivery milestone with the rollout of a complete QA framework to adopters. The intent is now to validate the framework in a live environment before scaling it to wider adoption.
