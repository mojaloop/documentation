# QA Framework Workstream
The overall objective of this workstream is to develop a QA Framework that can be used to validate the configuration, functionality, security, interoperability readiness and performance of a deployment. This framework might be used by adopters to "self certify", or it might be used by an external reviewer to create a level of assurance for supervisory authorities and participants.

# Business Justification
A QA Framework provides a consistent approach for stakeholders to assess the quality and readiness of Mojaloop deployments, supporting independent evaluations of resilience, security, and functional integrity. By establishing a structured approach to assessing deployments, the framework helps:

- Deployment teams identify and address gaps early
- Participants assess operational readiness before onboarding
- Regulators or supervisory bodies interpret implementation quality based on objective inputs
- The Mojaloop community share best practices and align on minimum expectations.

## Latest Update (Summary)
The draft QA Framework is now published on GitHub and Slack and available for immediate use by the community. Feedback from adopters will shape future refinement. Early discussions explore the possibility of an automated version of the framework to assess deployment quality as part of the deployment pipeline. Full automation remains a longer-term goal.
