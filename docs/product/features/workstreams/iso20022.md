# ISO 20022 Refinement Workstream
This workstream focusses on refining the ISO 20022 implementation released with Mojaloop V17.0.0 based on the experiences of adopters. This includes any refinements to the ISO 20022 messages defined in the Market Practice Document (MPD), and updates to the MPD itself.

# Business Justification
ISO 20022 is rapidly becoming the global standard for payment-system messaging, and Mojaloop’s ISO 20022 IIPS message standards, including Agreement of Terms (AoT), align with this global shift. However, the details re not yet finalised, and further refinement may well be likely.
