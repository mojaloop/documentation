# Deploying Mojaloop
There is a range of different reasons to deploy Mojaloop, ranging from a desire to learn more about Mojaloop or a wish to evaluate its suitability for some purpose, through developers who wish to develop or test new features, or perhaps an adopter who wishes to evaluate its functionality and connectivity, through to a production-grade deployment of a national payments system.

## Deployment Guide

For each scenario, the Mojaloop Community has developed appropriate deployment tools. The following [deployment guide](./deployment/deploying.md) includes a matrix cross-referencing user types and the purpose of the deployment, including notes about the footprint/hardware expectation and the associated SLAs. For each, a deployment tool is recommended, and a separate table provides a brief introduction to each tool.

## Deployment Tools

Having established which deployment tool is appropriate for the reader's requirements, the [deployment tools guide](./deployment/tools.md) provides more details for each of the tools, including performance and security features each supports.

## Production Readiness

The Community has developed a self assessment matrix that can be used by adopters to assess the readiness of their Mojaloop deployment and their organisation to move to Production. Note that this document is not intended to form the basis of any formal assessment of production readiness of any Mojaloop deployment or scheme. It is intended only as a set of basic checks to ensure some important aspects of a production system have been considered. A full assessment of fit-for-purpose readiness of a Mojaloop deployment remains the responsibility of the scheme operator only.

You can [view the matrix here](./Production_Readiness_Technical_Assessment.md), and the form can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/mojaloop/product-council/tree/main/Documentation/Deployment%20Readiness) when you are ready to begin an assessment.
