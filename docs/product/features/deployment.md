# Deploying Mojaloop
There is a range of different reasons to deploy Mojaloop, ranging from a desire to learn more about Mojaloop or a wish to evaluate its suitability for some purpose, through developers who wish to develop or test new features, or perhaps an adopter who wishes to evaluate its functionality and connectivity, through to a production-grade deployment of a national payments system.

## Deployment Guide

For each scenario, the Mojaloop Community has developed appropriate deployment tools. The following [deployment guide](./deployment/deploying.md) includes a matrix cross-referencing user types and the purpose of the deployment, including notes about the footprint/hardware expectation and the associated SLAs. For each, a deployment tool is recommended, and a separate table provides a brief introduction to each tool.

## Deployment Tools

Having established which deployment tool is appropriate for the reader's requirements, the [deployment tools guide](./deployment/tools.md) provides more details for each of the tools, including performance and security features each supports.
