# DFSP Onboarding Playbook

This toolkit, which has been donated by Thitsaworks, comprises a set of tools and templates to assist with the planning and execution of a Mojaloop deployment, specifically focusing on DFSP onboarding. The tools are:
- A workplan template, including samples used in past deployments;
- An example end to end test case, in this case for payee-side DFSP integration;
- A Technical assessment form, used to define the technical assistance required by candidate DFSPs;
- A technical onboarding checklist;
- An API mapping template, used to map between Mojaloop Hub API elements and the corresponding actions required by the DFSP's back office;
- A plan for the setup of the security of the DFSP's connection to the Mojaloop Hub.
