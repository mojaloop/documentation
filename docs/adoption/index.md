# About the Mojaloop Business documents

Mojaloop Business documents are presented in two main groups:

* [**Scheme Choices**](#scheme-choices): documents that provide assistance with defining scheme rules, operating guidelines, as well as key business and design choices
* [**Hub Operations**](#hub-operations): guides that provide practical information about the various aspects of operating a Mojaloop Hub
