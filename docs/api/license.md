The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation believes that an economy that includes everyone, benefits everyone. In support of this goal, we asked leading mobile wallet technology providers Ericsson, Huawei, Mahindra-Comviva and Telepin to work together to create a set of APIs for interoperability within the digital financial services infrastructure. Together with consultants from **Interledger** and **Modusbox**, the group worked to produce the APIs documented below.

The underlying charitable goal for the API is to spur innovation and access to digital products and services that serve the financially underserved with a focus on interoperability, and strengthening and accelerating the availability of solutions that reflect the design principles of **L1P** as documented on www.leveloneproject.org. The contributors commit to making the relevant background technology which is provided to the API project necessary to implement the API in furtherance of the charitable goals available on a royalty-free basis.
