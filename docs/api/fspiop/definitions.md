The description for the **FSPIOP-URI** header field has been updated to be more specific. <br><br>4.

Following this, the data model as specified in Table 103 has been updated. For consistency, the data model for the **POST /participants/**_{Type}/{ID}_ and **POST /participants/**_{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}_ calls in Table 10 has been updated to include the optional ExtensionList element as well. <br><br>6. A new Section 6.5.2.2 is added to describe the process involved in the rejection of a quote. <br><br>7.
