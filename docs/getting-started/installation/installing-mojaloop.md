# Installing Mojaloop

Mojaloop is packaged and released as a set of [Helm Charts](https://github.com/mojaloop/helm) with various options for deployment and customization.  
Even if you are new to Mojaloop and unfamiliar with [Helm](https://helm.sh) / [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or if you just want to get the software up and running quickly, there are several options avaiable to deploy Mojaloop.

1. **Manual Deployment** - The Mojaloop [Deployment Guide](../../technical/deployment-guide/) is intended for those familiar with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Helm](https://helm.sh). This is a great place to start if you are thinking of deploying Mojaloop on an existing Kubernetes environment, or if you are interested in setting one up yourself.

2. **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)** - A comprehensive Mojaloop deployment aimed at giving users a starting point for production. IaC is highly automated ([Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)) and is extensible. To learn more about an the IaC review the [IaC Deployment blog](https://infitx.com/deploying-mojaloop-using-iac).

   IaC currently supports the following modular configurations:
   - [IaC AWS (Amazon Web Services) Platform](https://github.com/mojaloop/iac-aws-platform)
   - On-Prem (Coming Soon)

3. **Mini-Loop** - Install utilities for Mojaloop that offers an easy and efficient way to get started. The [mini-Loop](https://github.com/tdaly61/mini-loop) scripts enable you to deploy Mojaloop in the cloud or on your laptop / server with just a couple of commands. You can then easily run the [Mojaloop Testing Toolkit](https://github.com/mojaloop/ml-testing-toolkit#mojaloop-testing-toolkit) to interact and test your deployment.

4. **Azure Marketplace** - This is an Azure AKS native deployment and aims to give users a starting point for POC or pilot testing.  It is a simple deployment, with highly automated Microsoft ARM templates and deploys to managed Kubernetes for easier management. Run the [Mojaloop Testing Toolkit](https://github.com/mojaloop/ml-testing-toolkit#mojaloop-testing-toolkit) to interact and test your deployment.
