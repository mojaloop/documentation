# Recording funds in or funds out for a DFSP

The **DFSP Financial Positions** page allows you to record funds in or funds out in the Hub's ledgers in the case of movement of funds initiated by the DFSP: a DFSP deposits funds in their liquidity account or withdraws funds from their liquidity account.

To access the **DFSP Financial Positions** page, go to **Participants** > **DFSP Financial Positions**.
