# Searching for transfer data

The Finance Portal provides a transfer search page, which allows you to find transfer data based on DFSP identifiers, end user identifiers, or transfer identifiers. This is useful when resolving issues.

::: tip NOTE
The values displayed on the **Find Transfers** page are pulled from the Hub's central-ledger database.

## Finding transfers

To find transfers, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Transfers** > **Find Transfers**. The **Find Transfers** page is displayed. \
<img src="../../.vuepress/public/find_transfers.png" width="90%" height="90%" />
1. Use the search filters to specify what you are looking for. You can fill in any number of search fields, in any combination.
    * **Transfer ID**: Enter a full `transferId` or a fragment of a `transferId`.
    * **Payer FSP ID**: Enter the full `fspId` or a fragment of the `fspId` of the Payer DFSP.
    * **Payer ID Type**: Using the drop-down list, select the type of identifier used to identify the Payer (for example, **MSISDN** or **ACCOUNT_ID**). 
    * **Payer ID Value**: Enter the full identifier or a fragment of the identifier used to identify the Payer (for example, a phone number or a bank account number).
    * **Payee FSPID**: Enter the full `fspId` or a fragment of the `fspId` of the Payee DFSP.
    * **Payee ID Type**: Using the drop-down list, select the type of identifier used to identify the Payee. 
    * **Payee ID Value**: Enter the full identifier or a fragment of the identifier used to identify the Payee.
    * **From** and **To**: Enter the start time and end time of the time range when the transfer(s) you are looking for happened.
1. Once you have set your search filters, click **Find Transfers**. The list of search results that meet the search criteria are displayed.

Use the page navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen to navigate between pages of search results.

You can remove all the filters you applied and start your search from scratch by clicking **Clear Filters**.

Search results are displayed in columns. All columns are sortable:

* Click a column header to change the sort order of the values displayed in the column.
* Click the magnifying-glass icon in the column header and enter a value that you are looking for.

::: tip
The total number of transfers that get returned are limited to a thousand (1000) (this is to keep the load off the backend). If you are not able to find the transfer that you are looking for within the first thousand results, then start narrowing your search, using the search filters. \
 \
If your search returns more than five hundred (500) results, the page will display an information message so you know that you do not necessarily see all results that meet your original search criteria and you should drill down more.
