note over PISP, DFSP
  Here the user goes through the web authentication process with their DFSP.
  The end result is a redirect back to the PISP with a special URL parameter indicating to the PISP that it should wait to be notified about a credential.

autonumber 1 "<b>AUTH-#</b>"

note over PISP, DFSP
  At this point, the DFSP believes that the User is their customer and that User trusts the PISP. This means that the DFSP can continue by granting consent.

  Note that the DFSP never "responds" to the Consent Request itself. Instead, it will create a Consent resource in the Grant phase.
