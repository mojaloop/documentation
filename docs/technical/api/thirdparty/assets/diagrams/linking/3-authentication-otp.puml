title PISP Linking: Authentication (OTP)

box "Mojaloop"
    participant Switch
end box

participant "DFSP" as DFSP

autonumber 1 "<b>AUTH-#</b>"

...

note over PISP, DFSP
  Here the user provides the OTP sent directly to them by the DFSP into the PISP App. It's then used as the secret to prove to the DFSP that the user trusts the PISP.
end note

...

PISP -> Switch ++: ""PATCH /consentRequests/11111111-0000-0000-0000-000000000000""\n\
    ""  FSIOP-Source: pispa""\n\
    ""  FSIOP-Destination: dfspa""\n\
"" {""\n\
    ""  authToken: "<OTP>" ""\n\
    ""}""
Switch --> PISP: ""202 Accepted""
deactivate PISP

Switch -> DFSP ++: ""PATCH /consentRequests/11111111-0000-0000-0000-000000000000""\n\
    ""  FSIOP-Source: pispa""\n\

"" {""\n\
    ""  authToken: "<OTP>" ""\n\
    ""}""
DFSP --> Switch: ""202 Accepted""
deactivate Switch

DFSP -> DFSP: Verify the OTP is correct.

note over PISP, DFSP
  At this point, the DFSP believes that the User is their customer and that User trusts the PISP. This means that the DFSP can continue by granting consent.

  Note that the DFSP never "responds" to the Consent Request itself. Instead, it will create a Consent resource in the Grant phase.
