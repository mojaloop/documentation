## Transaction Patterns

The interactions and examples of how a DFSP and PISP will interact with the Third Party API can be found in the following Transaction Patterns Documents:

1. [Linking](./transaction-patterns-linking.md) describes how an account link and credential can be established between a DFSP and a PISP
2. [Transfer](./transaction-patterns-transfer.md) describes how a PISP can initate a payment from a DFSP's account using the account link
