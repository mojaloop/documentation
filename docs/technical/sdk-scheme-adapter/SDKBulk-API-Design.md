# Support for Bulk Transfers - API Design
This design document describes how the SDK Scheme Adapter has been designed to support the bulk transfers use case.

## Mojaloop bulk transfer limitations overcome
The implementation of bulk transfers within Mojaloop have the following limitations that this SDK bulk design is designed to overcome.
1. Only individual transfers that are addressed to the same Payer DFSP may be included in a bulk quotes and bulk transfers call.
1. The bulk quotes and bulk transfers messages is limited to a maximum of 1000 individual transfers.
1. In order to allow a bulk transfers, all potential Payee DFSP's need to create integration support for bulk messaging. I.e. If the bulk use case were to be introduced into an existing scheme, then all connecting DFSPs would need to upgrade their connections and integrations into their core banking systems.
1. There is currently no bulk discovery call.

## SDK Scheme Adapter bulk design requirements
The design caters for:
1. Transfers where the discovery has not yet been called.
1. No limit on number of transfers
1. Payee integration support for bulk being optional
1. Optionally support 
   - a single call that performs Discovery, Agreement and Transfer
   - independently accepting of party lookups
   - independently accepting of quotes
   - setting a fee limit on the auto acceptance of quotes
   - the skipping of the discovery phase
   - running only the discovery phase
   - setting an expiration for the bulk message
   - home transaction Id's for both the bulk message and the individual transfers.
   - both synchronous API calls and asynchronous API calls

## Sequence Diagram
Here is a sequence diagram that outlines the role that the SDK Scheme Adapter will play in a bulk call, both for a Payer DFSP and a Payee DFSP.

## Error Tables for bulk transfers
[Table of Error Codes](./assets/sequence/BULK-ERRORCODES.md)

### Discovery Phase
All the errors encountered during this phase will be accumulated in the mojaloop-connector and will be added to the `lastError` object and returned to the payer along with all other successful or failed transfers involved in the bulk transfer request.

mojaloop-connector will act as a pass-through for all the errors returned by the switch

```
            "lastError": {
              "httpStatusCode": 202,
              "mojaloopError": {
                "errorInformation": {
                  "errorCode": "3204",
                  "errorDescription": "Party not found",
                  "extensionList": {"extension": [{"key": "string","value": "string"}]}
                }
              }
            }
```

### Transfer Phase
All the errors encountered during this phase will be accumulated in the mojaloop-connector and will be added to the `lastError` object and returned to the payer along with all other successful or failed transfers involved in the bulk transfer request.

mojaloop-connector will act as a pass-through for all the errors returned by the switch

```
            "lastError": {
              "httpStatusCode": 404,
              "mojaloopError": {
                "errorInformation": {
                  "errorCode": "3210",
                  "errorDescription": "Bulk transfer ID not found",
                  "extensionList": {"extension": [{"key": "string","value": "string"}]}
                }
              }
            }
```
