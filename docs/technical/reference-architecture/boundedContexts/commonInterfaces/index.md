# Common Interface List

The Common Interface List includes a list of all of the common interfaces that are in use in the Mojaloop 2.0 Reference Architecture presently.  Common Interfaces are used by several Bounded Contexts, hence the name.

Each Common Interface listed includes the following information: source or publisher event name or endpoint, communications style, publisher/provider Bounded Context, a description of the interface function, and a checklist of Bounded Contexts where it is being used.
