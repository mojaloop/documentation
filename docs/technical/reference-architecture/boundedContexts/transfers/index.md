# Transfers BC

The Transfers BC is responsible for orchestrating transfer requests.  It works in concert with a number of other BCs, notably Settlements, Scheduling, Participant Lifecycle Management, Accounts & Balances, and the FSPIOP.

## Terms

The following terms are used in this BC, also known as a domain.

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| **Accounts** | Refers to accounts used in all transfer activities.  They are used to record credit and debit positions, either temporarily in the case of accounts allocated for transfer purposes, or permanently in the case of final transfer updates to participant accounts. |
| **Participant/Actor** | Typically refers to DFSP Payer/Payee parties using Mojaloop. |
| **IGS** | Transfer settle method - Immediate Gross Settlement.  This process is typically used in high volume environments such as retail, and is used by individual and shared accounts.  In shared account environments, the system is capable of updating Participants balances by updating the proportional value of each Participants holds of the total funds available in the account |
| **DNS** | Transfer settlement method - Deferred Net Settlement. This process is frequently used in enviroments where a party of Participants engage in a single Transfer requiring settlement to all Participants. A typical example might include a scenario where raw materials are sold by Participant A to Participant B to manufacture into a finished product, which is then sold by Participant B back to Participant A. The switch calculates the proportional value that each Participant to the transaction is due, and settles this amount when the Settlement Window closes. |

## Canonical Model

Mojaloop uses two canonical models to manage funds transfers, one for non-bulk transfers, and one for bulk transfers.

### Standard Canonical Model

* Transfer
  * transferId
  * transferType
  * quoteld (optional)
  * settlementModelId
  * Participants
    * Payer
      * participantId
      * Accounts
        * Debit
          * accountId
          * accountType
          * currency
        * Credit
          * accountId
          * accountType
          * currency
    * Payee
      * ParticipantId
      * Accounts
        * Debit
          * accountId
          * accountType
          * currency
        * Credit
          * accountId
          * accountType
          * currency
  * Amount (Amount to transfer)
    * value (number)
    * currency (ISO currency code)
  * expiration (ISO dateTime)
  * ilpPacket
  * Extensions

### Bulk Canonical Model

* Transfers
  * bulkId
  * bulkQuoteId
  * Transfers[]
    * Transfer* (see above)

## Concluding Comments

* The Payer FSP should not be permitted to unilaterally time-out a transfer (irrespective of its expiration time), but should respect the Switch's timeout decisions.
* Validation of cryptographic conditions and fulfillment would be managed by the Transfers BC as it is a fundamental component of the "transfer" process (i.e.: function is not specific to the FSPIOP language)
* The Transfers BC will apply the same validation pattern as the Quoting & Party BC to validate Participants, to determine the ability of an Account to transact, or if a Participant is enabled as mutually exclusive.
* The Transfers BC is the single "source of truth" for all transfers, and is thus responsible for persisting the state/s of transfer's.
* Disabling Participants already in a "prepared" state should not hinder processing of current transfers, however new transfer instructions received by the Transfers BC via the TransferPrepareAccountAllocated events should be declined.
