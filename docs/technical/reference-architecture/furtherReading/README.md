## Team Resources

During the Reference Architecture planning work sessions, the Team made use of different resources to build and retain a record of discussions and to build the Use Case Models required to support all of the possible stakeholder requirements for the new architecture.

Please feel free to visit the Team’s resources using the links provided.

**P.S.** One resource that you might find particularly useful is Miro, where we keep a record of all of the Bounded Context Use Cases in use by the system.

***Note:** Please bear in mind that the Reference Architecture document is a living document, and as a result is updated from time to time for various reasons.  This means that the resources that we have shared with you are still in use and will change occasionally.*

| [*Use Case*, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) | In brief, and quoting from the opening blurb of the Wikipedia article, a use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or as contractual statements. |
