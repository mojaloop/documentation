# Mojaloop Release Process

The Mojaloop Release process follows a community led approach, specifically technical work-stream led, in collaboration and consultation with the Product Council and the Design Authority (DA).

The DA frames the policies, guidelines and technical criteria for the releases (such as quality metrics) while Product defines the feature and product requirements where such aspects are involved. This is executed by the relevant workstream(s).

The Mojaloop Release process follows a
- community led approach
- specifically technical work-stream led
- in collaboration and consultation with the Product Council and
- the Design Authority (DA)

Criteria, guidelines:
The DA frames policies, guidelines and technical criteria for the releases while Product defines the feature and product requirements
Example releases notes, criteria for v17.0.0, [v17.0.0](https://github.com/mojaloop/helm/releases/tag/v17.0.0)

Testing continues after the release is made as well and daily cron jobs run to test, until the next release is made, to ensure stability.

**Current tasks and acceptance criteria for Mojaloop (helm) releases**:

Example story: [3122](https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/3122) , [3847](https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/3847)

## 2. Mojaloop Release process - proposed updates:

Propose release schedule and timelines

1. Example: Feature freeze for a (major) release before six weeks prior to the next PI kick-off (or community event)
1. Freeze bug fixes (non critical) to be included four weeks prior to release date
1. RC to be validated by at least one downstream implementer such Mini-loop or IaC or Core-test-harness or another implementer
1. Release to move ahead on time if there are no high or medium priority bugs open in RC and validated on a dev environment and one downstream team / implementer
1. Streamline release numbers between various components of the Mojaloop platform, such as the Finance Portal
1. Include performance numbers with details on the setup on which the baselining was performed
1. Resource usage: capture resource footprint for a base release
1. Document support mechanisms for Mojaloop releases
