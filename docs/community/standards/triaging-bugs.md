# Triaging Mojaloop OSS bugs

### Raising a bug / issue

If there is a bug or issue in general an issue is logged as a bug or feature request on the [project](https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/new/choose) repository and in some cases linked to an issue logged on the repository for that specific component.

There is a bug [template](https://github.com/mojaloop/project/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) that can be used and encourages use of details such as versions, expected results and other details, which help with triage and reproducing the issue.

### Once a bug is logged

1. Typically, the bug is initially triaged in the [#ml-oss-bug-triage](https://mojaloop.slack.com/messages/CMCVBHPUH) public channel on Mojaloop Slack
2. For Security and other sensitive issues, the bug is triaged on a private channel with current contributors, before information is made public at an appropriate time. Details for security issues are covered here: https://docs.mojaloop.io/community/contributing/cvd.html
3. During bug triage, priority and severity are assigned to the bug after majority consensus and consultation with reporter(s)
4. Based on the priority and severity the bug is taken up by the Core team or other contributors based on a collaborative effort.
5. Once it is taken up, conversation and updates happen on GitHub issue and slack channel.

### Triage

1. The discussion regarding the issue is open to a public for normal bugs / issues
2. Based on the discussions, a final call on the priority and severity of the issue is made by the Core team in consultation with the reporter(s).
3. The list and the process will be updated as it evolves.
