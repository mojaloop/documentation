# API Documentation

All APIs should be documented in RAML or Swagger, see [Architecture-Documentation-Guidelines](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop/blob/main/contribute/Architecture-Documentation-Guidelines.md)


**Section Headings**

* Do not number headings - for example, "Prepare and Fulfill", not "C - Prepare and Fulfill"
* Make sure section headings \(\# \) match the heading to which they correspond in the comprehensive PDF \(built from the [dactyl config file](https://github.com/Mojaloop/Docs/blob/master/ExportDocs/dactyl-config.yml)\)
* Do not include the word "documentation" in headings

#### Retrievability

* For sections that contain many subsections of endpoints or methods, provide a table of contents at the beginning of the section
* Don't say the word project; use component, microservice, interfaces, etc

#### Language

Instead of the word "project," use a specific noun such as component, microservice, or interface.

#### Procedures

* Introduce procedures with H3 \(\#\#\#\) or H4 \(\#\#\#\#\) headers \(not H2 \(\#\#\)\).
* Do not use numbers in procedure section headings.
* Use ordered-list tagging for procedure steps. For example:
* Step 1
* Step 2
* Step 2
