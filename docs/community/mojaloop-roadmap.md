# The Mojaloop Roadmap

The roadmap is built around the concept of three pillars, which are:

1. Make it easier to deploy Mojaloop
2. Make sure deployments have every opportunity to make themselves profitable
3. Connect to other payments services in the ecosystem

These three pillars are underpinned by a fourth workstream, that of continuous development of a quality
product.

    * Pre-configs for different deployment types
  * On-Prem
  * Azure
* Better Showcase
* Capitalise on MiniLoop
  * Demos etc as part of deployment
  * Testing support (Quality Product)
