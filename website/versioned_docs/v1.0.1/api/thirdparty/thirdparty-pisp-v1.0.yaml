                          The API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular expression to avoid characters which are generally not used in a name.

                          Regular Expression - The regular expression for restricting the Name type is "^(?!\s*$)[\w .,'-]{1,128}$". The restriction does not allow a string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode characters are allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe (‘), dash (-), comma (,) and space characters ( ).

                          **Note:** In some programming languages, Unicode support must be specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used, the flag UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.

                          IMPORTANT: The policy for defining addresses and the life-cycle of these is at the discretion of the address space owner (the payer DFSP in this case).

        A DFSP uses this callback to (1) inform the PISP that the consentRequest has been accepted,
        and (2) communicate to the PISP which `authChannel` it should use to authenticate their user
        with.

        When a PISP requests a series of permissions from a DFSP on behalf of a DFSP’s customer, not all
        the permissions requested may be granted by the DFSP. Conversely, the out-of-band authorization
        process  may result in additional privileges being granted by the account holder to the PISP. The
        **PUT /consentRequests/**_{ID}_ resource returns the current state of the permissions relating to a
        particular authorization request.

        The HTTP request `PUT /thirdpartyRequests/authorizations/{ID}/error` is used by the DFSP or PISP to inform
        the other party that something went wrong with a Thirdparty Transaction Authorization Request.

        The PISP may use this to tell the DFSP that the Thirdparty Transaction Authorization Request is invalid or doesn't
        match a `transactionRequestId`.

        The DFSP may use this to tell the PISP that the signed challenge returned in `PUT /thirdpartyRequest/authorizations/{ID}`
        was invalid.

                            [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
                            Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the

                            - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
                            participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
                            [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                            - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                            Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                            number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                            the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                            PartySubIdOrType element.
                            - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                            is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                            format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                            in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                            - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                            specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.

                            use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                            - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                            reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                            as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                            - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                            participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric

                            - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                            created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                            Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                            The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                            PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                            by the PartyIdentifier.
                            - CONSENT - A Consent represents an agreement between a PISP, a Customer and
                            a DFSP which allows the PISP permission to perform actions on behalf of the
                            customer. A Consent has an authoritative source: either the DFSP who issued
                            the Consent, or an Auth Service which administers the Consent.
                            - THIRD_PARTY_LINK - A Third Party Link represents an agreement between a PISP,
                            a DFSP, and a specific Customer's account at the DFSP. The content of the link
                            is created by the DFSP at the time when it gives permission to the PISP for
                            specific access to a given account.

                The issuing PISP will expect a response to their request for a transfer which describes the finalized state of the requested transfer.
                This response will be given by a PATCH call on the /thirdpartyRequests/transactions/{ID} resource.
                The {ID} given in the query string should be the transactionRequestId which was originally used by the PISP to identify the transaction request.

                            - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant. The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en). Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the international prefix.
                            - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                            - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant. Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the PartySubIdOrType element.
                            - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company) is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                            - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party. For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization, use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                            - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format, as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                            - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                            - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner. Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system. The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined by the PartyIdentifier.
