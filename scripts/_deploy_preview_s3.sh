# deploys the preview docs to an s3 bucket
# I manually created the bucket: `mojaloop-docs-preview`
# in the eu-west-2 region
# and followed the guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EnableWebsiteHosting.html
# to manually configure the bucket for website hosting
# And this guide: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/
# to set up Cloudfront and Route53
# "Using a REST API endpoint as the origin, with access restricted by an OAI"

# The website should be available at:
# http://mojaloop-docs-preview.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com
# or http://docs-preview.moja-lab.live/

# Required tools:
# - aws-cli
# - aws-mfa (if running as user, not CI)
