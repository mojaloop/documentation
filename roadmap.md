## SUPPORTING Workstreams
* API “front of house” & Sandbox - this will become our re-use of Mojaloop Sandbox towards MAS re-use for next quarter, and launch of the 3PPI api into it.  The work is focused to that outcome.

* “Core” - repos, bug fix, maintenance, ttk etc - can we rebrand this workstream as part of setting the mission up??? Core work is done above.

* Code Quality and Security - the current team itself currently are doing work in above workstreams.  Can we ensure this mission is focused on reporting work not already covered by above teams objectives?

* Community

* Documentation
