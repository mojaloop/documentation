      description: The HTTP request GET /participants/{Type}/{ID} is used to find out in which FSP the requested Party, defined by {Type} and {ID} is located (for example, GET /participants/MSISDN/123456789). This HTTP request should support a query string to filter FSP information regarding a specific currency only (This similarly applies to the SubId). To query a specific currency only, the HTTP request GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ should be used, where XYZ is the requested currency. Note - Both the currency and the SubId can be used mutually inclusive or exclusive

    title: PartyIdTypeEnum
    description: Below are the allowed values for the enumeration - MSISDN An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant. The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the ITU-T E.164 standard. Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the international prefix. - EMAIL An email is used as reference to a participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational RFC 3696. - PERSONAL_ID A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant. Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the PartySubIdOrType element. - BUSINESS A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company) is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used. - DEVICE A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party. For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization, use the PartySubIdOrType element. - ACCOUNT_ID A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format, as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP. - IBAN A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric characters and should be entered without whitespace. - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner. Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system. The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined by the PartyIdentifier.
